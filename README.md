Project Name: LSTM-Based Next Word Prediction Model in NLP

Description:
This project aims to develop a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based model for predicting the next word in a sequence within the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The model leverages LSTM's ability to capture long-term dependencies and contextual nuances in language, enhancing prediction accuracy and context understanding in various NLP tasks such as text generation, machine translation, and speech recognition.

Files Included:
1. `naan.ipynb`: Python script containing code for data preparation, model design, training, evaluation, and prediction using the LSTM-based next word prediction model.
2. `requirements.txt`: Text file listing all the dependencies required to run the project. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
3. `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for training and evaluation. Data preprocessing steps are included in the `model.py` script.
4. `README.md`: Markdown file providing instructions, project overview, usage guidelines, and additional information about the project.

Usage:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/lstm-next-word-prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd lstm-next-word-prediction`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the `model.py` script to train the model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions for next words in a sequence.
